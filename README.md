# SiloamSee

Unofficial fork of RTAB-Map (https://github.com/introlab/rtabmap) Android Tango application.

Adds GPS co-ordinates to the starting point of each map as well as magnetometer data into the zip of an exported textured mesh that is saved to the sd-card.

Built by root user of a fresh install of Ubuntu Xenial 16.04 LTS.

Obviously this is not ideal.

This will be changed in the future when the final code is merged with the "Siloam" repo
